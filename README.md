# Introduction

This work was developed by FAPEMIG scholarship holder [Bruno M. Silva](http://lattes.cnpq.br/7610286860591449) and by professor [J. Miguel Ortega](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8047-9191) from Federal University of Minas Gerais. The web tool was made in collaboration with [Romildo Oliveira](https://github.com/MildoDev).

This tool allows data visualization and interaction related to transcriptomes assemblies and the expression levels of transcribed genes of many organisms. We have the following functions available:

* An index page containing all data related to the experiments data used to perform the transcriptome assembly;
* A customized Unirprot ID Mapping search table;
* Search genes and transcripts annotations;
* Retrieve all data related to Blast, HMMER and PFAM alignment;
* Vizualize and interact with expression data graphs;
* Get all data related to a specific transcript/gene;
* Run a Diamond BlastP/BlastX in all assembled transcriptomes.
